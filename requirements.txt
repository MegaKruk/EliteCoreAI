# Elite Dangerous Core Mining Detector
# Python 3.12.4 on Windows 11
#
# Install with:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 (for RTX 3070) must be installed first - pip can't
# pick the right CUDA build automatically, so run this line manually BEFORE
# running pip install -r requirements.txt:
#
#   pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
#
# After that, the rest installs normally with the command above.

# --- core ML ---
ultralytics>=8.2.0          # YOLOv8 training + inference + export

# --- data + config ---
numpy>=1.26.0               # array math, used everywhere
pyyaml>=6.0.1               # reading and writing data.yaml config files
pandas>=2.2.0               # ultralytics uses it for results.csv parsing

# --- visualization ---

onnx>=1.16.0                # needed to export models to ONNX format
onnxruntime-gpu>=1.18.0     # run ONNX models fast on GPU in the companion app
                            # use onnxruntime (no -gpu) if you want CPU-only inference
